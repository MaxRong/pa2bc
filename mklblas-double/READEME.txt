Notes on Nov 15, 2025 on Expanse using a machine from the shared cluster partition

Step 1:  Execute the following commands

module load gpu/0.15.4 intel/19.0.5.281


Step 2: Comiple two files blasmm.c and blas2.c

	make

Step 3 Run blasmm on an acquired machine core with 1 thread using a job script 
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1


To run 8 threads with 8 cores, modify runblasmm.sh with 8 node requests also:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
Then submit a job (the login node does not seem to allow the use of multiple cores)
	make runblasmm


Files:


blasmm.c
	--- Implement matrix matrix multiplication using 3 options
		1. Intel MKL library gemm based on the standard BLAS software.
			Notice that matrices are typically layed out with a column-major manner 
		2. Use  N gemv function calls with a nested loop
		3. Use a standard but naive implemenetation with 3 nested loops. 	
		 

	The compilation links MKL library on Expanse.

	To test it on the login node.
	make localrunblasmm

blas2.c --- An example of BLAS2 gemv  with small matrices to illustrate
			the column-major layout of matrices.
 
	To test it on the login node.
	make localrunblas2
